<h1>---My phamaceutical nightmare courtesy of --- <a href = "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a698016.html">Finasteride---</a></h1>
<p>On October 17, 2020 I made the worst decision of my life to-date. I began taking the hormone disrupting drug called <a href = "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a698016.html">Finasteride</a>, to treat a practically non-existent harloss issue. The story starts actually a year earlier in 2019. While browsing facebook one day one of its adds popped on to my screen for the online hairloss service called Keeps. Keeps offers its clients the opportunity to get a suite of harloss treatments through its online store and access to virtual doctor consultations that make prescription drugs accessible through the internet. I didn't have a bald spot but had some thinning of my hair that I was beginning to notice, so I decided to signup. Its easy .. you take a few snapshots of your head, upload them to the sight and a few days later a virtual doctor gives you a hairloss diagnosis and suggests a treatment plan.

    <h2>2019 - no way im taking finasteride </h2>
    <p>So weeks later, at my doorstep came the harloss drugs. No you think I just plopped on the rogain and took the finasteride pills, right? Wrong. I did my research on both and was astounded by what I'd read about finasteride. It said it could cause sexual disfunction, like impotence and lowered labido, and a whole array of other terrifying side effects. At that moment i said to myself I wasn't going to touch finasteride, cause I knew that with my paranoia and anxiety that if the drug didn't give me those side effects, my mind would ... I even consulted Serota about my concern and his response did little to reassure me, but perhaps it raised enough doubt in me to make the fateful decision to try it ... amost exactly one year later. </p>

    <p>So 2019 and early 2020 continued on rather uneventfully (except for covid) and peacefully. I started applying minoxidil (rogain) once a day, and let the bottles of finastride sit untouched in my bathroom closet.
