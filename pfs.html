<h1>October 17, 2020 - My pharmaceutical nightmare begins ---</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>On October 17, 2020 I made the worst decision of my life to-date. I began taking the hormone disrupting drug called <a href = "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a698016.html">Finasteride</a>, to treat a practically non-existent harloss issue. <br><br> The story starts actually a year earlier in 2019. While browsing facebook one day one of its adds popped on to my screen for the online hairloss service called Keeps. Keeps offers its clients the opportunity to get a suite of harloss treatments through its online store and access to virtual doctor consultations that make prescription drugs accessible through the internet. I didn't have a bald spot but had some thinning of my hair that I was beginning to notice, so I decided to signup. Its easy .. you take a few snapshots of your head, upload them to the sight and a few days later a doctor virtual doctor gives you a hairloss diagnosis and suggests a treatment plan.
