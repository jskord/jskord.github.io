<h2>What is finasteride and what is post finasteride syndrome?</h2>
<p>Finasteride is a drug that is used for treatment of an enlarged prostate and mail pattern baldness. It was approved by the FDA in 1992 to treat the former and 1997 to treat the latter. 
  <img src="finasteride chemical structure.png">
  <br><br>
  <p>Finasteride treats these conditions by blocking the metabolism of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is known to cause enlargement of the prostate and damage hair follicales on the scalp. However, DHT does alot of good things for the male body, and it is not a good idea to mess with it. Because if you do you might develop <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6369643/'>post finasteride syndrome.</a> And that is the syndrome I either have or think I have, and I haven't yet figured out which one that is, nor which one might be easier to overcome.</p>

<h2>Justin meet Keeps. Keeps meet Justin.</h2>
<p>On October 17, 2020 I made the worst decision of my life to-date. I began taking the hormone disrupting drug called <a href = "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a698016.html">Finasteride</a>, to treat a practically non-existent harloss issue. The story starts actually a year earlier in 2019. While browsing facebook one day one of its adds popped on to my screen for the online hairloss service called Keeps. Keeps offers its clients the opportunity to get a suite of harloss treatments through its online store and access to virtual doctor consultations that make prescription drugs accessible through the internet. I didn't have a bald spot but had some thinning of my hair that I was beginning to notice, so I decided to signup. Its easy .. you take a few snapshots of your head, upload them to the sight and a few days later a virtual doctor gives you a hairloss diagnosis and suggests a treatment plan.

  <br><br><i>Dr. Marc Serota prescribing the infamous poison (finasteride) to me which I ingested for 2 months in the fall of 2020...</i>
    <h2>2019 - no way im taking finasteride </h2>
    <p>So weeks later, at my doorstep came the harloss drugs. Now you think I just plopped on the rogain and took the finasteride pills, right? Wrong. I did my research on both and was astounded by what I'd read about finasteride. It said it could cause sexual disfunction, like impotence and lowered labido, and a whole array of other terrifying side effects. At that moment i said to myself I wasn't going to touch finasteride, cause I knew that with my paranoia and anxiety that if the drug didn't give me those side effects, my mind would ... I even consulted Serota about my concern and his response did little to reassure me, but perhaps it raised enough doubt in me to make the fateful decision to try it ... amost exactly one year later. </p>

    <br><br><i>the sketchy doc telling me finasteride is nothing to worry about ... Bottoms up!</i>
    <p>So 2019 and early 2020 continued on rather uneventfully (except for covid) and peacefully. I started applying minoxidil (rogain) once a day, and let the bottles of finastride sit untouched in my bathroom closet. Checkout some snapshots of what life was like in the months leading up to my pharmaceutical nightmare</p>

    <br><br>
    <h2>The fateful decision</h2>
    <p>As I stated earlier I took my first pill of fanasteride on October the 17 -- there were many factors that led me to make this poor decision and I will try to cover the key ones.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My 2020 checkup from Keeps</li>
      <p> As October 2020 rolled around --- keeps ... the diligent online medical service sent an email that it was time for a checkup, and I complied -- uploading fresh photos of my follicles. I even intelligently used the opportunity to tell the 'fine' folks of Keeps that i wanted to switch to just a minoxodil plan, leave out the finasteride thankyou verymuch. So seems like im handling my self quite well in this encounter, right? Then how was it a contributing factor to my decision to take finasteride a week later? Probably because the experience just put the hairloss topic a little closer to my waking assortment of daily thoughts that recieved my attention.</p>
      <br><br>
      <img src='2020 hair shots.png'>
      <br><br>
      <i>may hair in October 2020. Does this look like a person that needs to take hormone blockers to prevent hairloss? No. And that is what makes my situation even more painful to ruminate on ... :(</i>
      <br><br>
      <li>An ended relationship</li>
      <p>Believe it or not the Summer of 2020 was actually a relatively successful in the dating world for me. I was dating two girls and both of them seemed to like me. Don't get me wrong ... i was not being covid careless. My first three dates with one of the girls was socially distanced, and I only had one socially distanced date with the other .. though we chatted more frequently, playing online chess and texting atleast weekly, starting from before the covid pandemic. However, the one I liked more was the one that dumped me after the 4th date. She sent me a standard lets be friends text on october 17. And it put me in a bad mood, you might even say insecure. Insecurity is a powerful emotion --- might even be strong enough to make a man take a risky medication for a non-existent hairloss issue.</p>

      <i>The song I sang to myself after a text-rejection from a girl on October 17, 2020</i>
      <br><br>
      <li>Covid 19</li>
      <p>Now Covid is tricky, and its a prickly subject for me ... becuse I've had to endure a support system that keeps attributing my current situation to another soul afflicted with mental disturbance on account of the pandemic. Maybe their right .. but i havent had that appifiny yet. But currently what I can glean is that Covid did affect my hair. I was an extreme rule follower when it came to Covid. And that is why I didn't get a haircut for several months. The long hair looked good but it was hard not to notice. I started to daydream of having a long healthy ponytail. I've heard some chicks dig that. So in a perverted way I thought finasteride might help acheive my Covid tail </p>
      <br><br>

      <br><br>
      <i>Me starting to like the covid tail id developed late in 2020. But unfortunately finding some imperfections ... ones that i thought finasteride might fix??</i>
      <br><br>
      <li>Beer</li>
      <p>Most days of the week I have a couple beers before dinner, but on October 17 I had about 8. Why? I guess because of the rejection message from that girl. I won't blame myself for that. But its hard not to blame myself for making a sadistic and self destructive decision to take finasteride - because there is no way I would have taken that first pill if I was sober. What happened is I was about 6 beers in and I felt I had to make this night mean something more than just a guy getting drunk cause he's sad that a girl doesn't like him. So I thought about taking finasteride ... I said to myself ... I shit you not ... 'Ill never have the guts to start taking this stuff if im sober so I've got to do it now while i've got this liquit courage flooding my brain.' So popped the pill, passed out, and boarded the highway to hell.</p>

    <h1>The rest of October, 2020</h1>
    <p>There are some horror stories out there where people take one pill of this stuff and wake up the next day with complete erectile and cognitive dysfunction - If you're curious read-away on everybodies favorite place for obsessive and endless discussion on just about any topic that exists - <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/FinasterideSyndrome/'> reddit-finasteride-syndrome</a> But that's not what happened to me ... I proceeded to have a shitty rest of October ... but I attributed it to my recent rejection and not the finasteride ... but maybe I was wrong.</p>

    <h1>November, 2020</h1>
    <p>I went through november mostly unaware of what finasteride might be doing to me but there were several occurances ... looking back now ... that seem like they may have been the result of ingesting finasteride.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>blood sugar issues</li>
      <p>everybody knows the feeling when their blood sugar drops - you get light headed, weak, and shakey. That feeling happens when you haven't eaten for a considerable amount of time. But when it happens more than once in a week, and not after abstaining from food for very long, its a sign somethings our of wack with your body and its mechanisms for processing sugar. This happened to me twice in November. Once on a long drive back from conducting sampling, and once while waling my dog .. in the same week. Turns out finasteride infact <a href='https://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/2017/06/22/study-finds-popular-prostate-drug-has-serious-side-effects/'>adversely affects blood sugar</a> and my body, I think I went through a blood sugar hiccup that week, but instead of looking at a simple solution loke examining postential side effects of meds I was taking, I just worried about possibly having diabetes. Lesson: take a look at your medications and their side effects, early and often, early and often, early and often.</p>
      <br><br>
      <img src='early and often.png'/>
      <br><br>
      <i>being a relatively young and healthy lad, im afraid I wasn't acquanted with the practive of healthy skepticism over medications and what they might do to the body ... I thought was invincible</i>
      <li>headache? maybe its just the odouls</li>
      <p>As I stated earlier I typically have a couple beers most days of the week, but to counter that habbit I like to take extended breaks from time to time .. to recalibrate the bodies symptoms of regular alchohol use .. be it moderate or otherwise .. and in 2020 I decided I was going to make the entire month of November alchohol-free. So to get me started I bought a six-pack of Odouls, the well known brand of non-alchoholic. The first or second day after drinking my ration of odouls I experienced a headache ... which was odd because I don't get headaches very often, but I attributed it to some type of preservative or what-not lurking in the bottles of cheaply made non-alchoholic odouls, unfortunately those headaches came and went, if they'd been mor persistent I might have payed more attention to potential causes rather than blaming the easy target, the fine non-alchoholic beverage ... Odouls. But I think I was wrong ... it was finasteride, starting to ravage my brain, body, and manhood.
        <br><br>
      <img src='odouls.png'/> 
      <br><br>
      <i>me in my college days, drinking an odouls ... Their beverages never had caused me headaches before ... yet they did in november 2020 ... or so I thought. I think it was actually finasteride.</i>
      <h1>December, 2020</h1>
      <p> december is where shit really started to hit the fan.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Serious Brain Fog</li>
        <p>on December 1 I woke up with a headache like no other I'd ever experienced. It felt like it was deep in the center of my brain, later id conclude it was in my hypothalimus, where hormones are regulated by nerosteroids. Unlike in November, this headache persisted. And it was on this day that I finally thought i was getting side effects from taking finasteride. Later that week after about three days of the persistent headache I made an appointment with my GP. On the phone her nurse said it would be a good idea for me to come in but to also try clearing out some wax from my ears, as that can frequently be a cause of this type of headache. I tried this and felt immediate relief .. crisis averted .. or so I thought</p>
        <li>Depression starts to grow</li>
        <p>another thing that happened at the beginning of December was depression set in. One of the key ways I knew this was that I had successfully abstained from alchohol for the entirity of November, so having a couple beers on December 1 should have been something I was looking forward to, a source of accomplishment and pleasure, but it wasn't, and that was an unignorable sign of depression. Despite these two symptoms, headache and depression, that I was suspecting was attributable to side effects from finasteride, I marched on through the month of december quite functionally. But that was not the case for January 2021.</p>
        <br><br>
        <li>My last pill </li>
        <p>I took my last pill on December 18, 2020. On the evening of December 17 I was feeling agitated, anxious, and depressed. I was about 90% sure at this point I was dealing with finasterite side effects. I had remembered that a week ago I took finasterite while feeling this way and the next day felt better. In retrospect it was like my body was starting to withdraw from the poison by the end of each week and when I would take my pill it would normalize and I would feel better. So that night I took finasteride. The next morning I had my first experience with panic attack immediately upon waking up. I decided to have a couple beers at 7 in the morning to calm myself down. This was a huge mistake. I felt 10 times worse after drinking them and this is when I started to develop my dependency on my family. Up to this point I was a strict rule follower of Covid-19 protocols so I was seeing no one indoors that I didn't live with (with the exception of the girl I dated that summer). But I decided I was getting so bad I had to join my families bubble. That night I spent at my sister's house in lake zurich. I drank and took some valume. And hungout with them. This was the start of me spreading my illness to my family, and their quest to carry me through this began.</p>

        <i>Xmas 2020, putting my best face on</i>



<br><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>



<i>Hey man. I am so sorry to hear you are going through this. I completely understand and relate to exactly what you are going through. I was there, in the pits of hell, 2 years ago. Suicidal depressed, symptoms were debilitating and severe, literally every facet of my life was impacted. I want you to listen to me now, this is temporary, the body can and will heal, you will get better, you will get through this. You need to stay strong. I am speaking from experience, how you feel now is the worst of it, recovery is slow & takes time, but if you follow what I’m about to tell you, your body will begin to heal and you will be on the path to recovery.
I would suggest you copy this comment and leave this forum and any other recovery forum. Do your best to avoid researching this stuff as it will only fuel your anxiety and depression. Here’s the path I would suggest you take to recover.
Based on my experience and research, going on HCG for an extended period, 3 months minimum, can be highly beneficial to restart the HPTA, StAR and neurosteroid cascade. Something I would suggest you look into and consider. Everyone is different though so proceed with caution and at your own risk. Obviously do your own research first and make an informed educated decision.
Mindset: I strongly believe my body has the ability to heal itself. The body has evolved over millions of years, surviving generation after generation through the most dire circumstances. The body has such incredible intelligence. It’s working every day to achieve optimum health. There is no doctor that is as intelligent as my body. It’s job is to maintain health. My body is fantastic, it is amazing, I am occupying my body, it wants to heal, it wants to be healthy, and I have to help it.
Sleep: Focus on good high quality sleep every single night without fail. Sleep is the #1 priority in my recovery protocol. The body heals itself when we sleep. Two hours before bed eliminate artificial light and stimualtion from computers, TV, phones, etc… Spend time focusing on meditation and relaxation. Aim to sleep at 9.00-9.30PM - the time you fall asleep is more important than how long you sleep. Listen to Shawn Stevensons podcast with Richroll for more information. Sleep is the MOST important thing for recovery. You could do everything else I’ve listed here, but without good high quality sleep every night, you will not recover. I also have a sunrise mimicking alarm clock and get 15-30minutes of sunlight first thing in the morning to strengthen the circadian rhythm.
Diet: Strictly avoid all inflammatory foods. No gluten, dairy, refined processed foods, take-away, refined oils, vegetable oils, refined sugar, etc. Limit intake of pro-inflammatory omega 6 fatty acids, increase intake of omega 3s. Eat a wide variety of plants and fiber to optimize gut health and build a strong gut microbiome. Lots of whole plant food - fruits, vegetables, potato, beans, whole grains etc. Consume wild caught fish and grass fed beef. Eating at maintenance or in a calorie surplus. No cheat meals.
Stress + Stimulation: Eliminate all stress and focus on staying calm & relaxed. Meditate and practice deep breathing daily. Spend time out in nature. Significantly reduce stimulation in the form of phone, computer & TV. Avoid violent movies & computer games. Focus on being in that calm, relaxed, parasympathetic state as much as possible. This is the state our body heals in. Practice mindfulness. Meditate daily.
Psychology: Positive and optimisic outlook. The mind is more powerful than any drug out there. You need to understand that you will recover, you need to believe that you will recover, you need to put your mind to it and truly believe that you will recover. Always chose to be optimistic and positive about everything. Realise that this is temporary. This is an opportunity for growth & development. You will be so much stronger after this experience. Always chose to be positive.
Gratefulness & Gratitude: Reminding myself every day what I am grateful for in my life. I truly believe I am lucky even though I have PFS. My life could have been so much worse. I could have been born in Syria and beheaded by ISIS. Or born in Africa and starved to death at 3 years old. Or slaughtered by machine gun fire on the front wave of the D Day landings. I could be paraplegic and be bedridden for the rest of my life. I will always chose to be grateful and positive for everything in my life, it could have been so much worse. I will not compare myself to my friends or other people I see on social media, instead I will be grateful for what I do have. This is an opportunity for transformation, I think of all the positives that will come from my situation, I will be able to appreciate the smaller things in life so much more once recovered, I always chose to be positive with everything in life.
Exercise: It’s very important that you don’t push yourself to exercise. If you feel worse after exercising, do not fucking do it, there’s a reason you feel worse and your body is trying to tell you that. Always listen to your body. Exercise can create a lot of inflammation and stress when your body is in a weak burdened state. I do believe walking daily can be very beneficial. Especially walks and hikes out in nature, being mindful and off the phone & technology. If you want to do exercise just walk. Walk barefoot on grass. Walk in nature. And always listen to your body.
Motivation & Information: I highly recommend the Youtube channel Health Recovery. James who runs the channel, spent I believe 8 years of his life suffering with severe chronic illness and recovered his health naturally through trial and error. I made the most ground with my recovery when I started listening to and following his advice. I personally have downloaded every single one of his videos (using J Downloader) and listen when I’m bored on my iPod. He gives fantastic information for our situation and is a really great source of motivation.</i>
