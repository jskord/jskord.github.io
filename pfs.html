<h2>What is finasteride and what is post finasteride syndrome?</h2>
<p>Finasteride is a drug that is used for treatment of an enlarged prostate and mail pattern baldness. It was approved by the FDA in 1992 to treat the former and 1997 to treat the latter.

  <br><br>
  <p>Finasteride treats these conditions by blocking the metabolism of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is known, in men,to cause enlargement of the prostate and damage hair follicales on the skalp. However, DHT does alot of good things for the male body, and it is not a good idea to mess with it, especially for cosmetic reasons.</p>
<h2>Justin meet Keeps. Keeps meet Justin.</h2>
<p>On October 17, 2020 I made the worst decision of my life to-date. I began taking the hormone disrupting drug called <a href = "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a698016.html">Finasteride</a>, to treat a practically non-existent harloss issue. The story starts actually a year earlier in 2019. While browsing facebook one day one of its adds popped on to my screen for the online hairloss service called Keeps. Keeps offers its clients the opportunity to get a suite of harloss treatments through its online store and access to virtual doctor consultations that make prescription drugs accessible through the internet. I didn't have a bald spot but had some thinning of my hair that I was beginning to notice, so I decided to signup. Its easy .. you take a few snapshots of your head, upload them to the sight and a few days later a virtual doctor gives you a hairloss diagnosis and suggests a treatment plan.

    <h2>2019 - no way im taking finasteride </h2>
    <p>So weeks later, at my doorstep came the harloss drugs. No you think I just plopped on the rogain and took the finasteride pills, right? Wrong. I did my research on both and was astounded by what I'd read about finasteride. It said it could cause sexual disfunction, like impotence and lowered labido, and a whole array of other terrifying side effects. At that moment i said to myself I wasn't going to touch finasteride, cause I knew that with my paranoia and anxiety that if the drug didn't give me those side effects, my mind would ... I even consulted Serota about my concern and his response did little to reassure me, but perhaps it raised enough doubt in me to make the fateful decision to try it ... amost exactly one year later. </p>

    <br><br><i>the sketchy doc telling me finasteride is nothing to worry about ... Bottoms up!</i>
    <p>So 2019 and early 2020 continued on rather uneventfully (except for covid) and peacefully. I started applying minoxidil (rogain) once a day, and let the bottles of finastride sit untouched in my bathroom closet.

    <h2>The fateful decision</h2>
    <p>As I stated earlier I took my first pill of fanasteride on October the 17 -- there were many factors that led me to make this poor decision and I will try to cover the key ones.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My 2020 checkup from Keeps</li>
      <p> As October 2020 rolled around --- keeps ... the diligent online medical service sent an email that it was time for a checkup, and I complied -- uploading fresh photos of my follicles. I even intelligently used the opportunity to tell the 'fine' folks of Keeps that i wanted to switch to just a minoxodil plan, leave out the finasteride thankyou verymuch. So seems like im handling my self quite well in this encounter, right? Then how was it a contributing factor to my decision to take finasteride a week later? Probably because the experience just put the hairloss topic a little closer to my waking assortment of daily thoughts that recieved my attention.</p>

      <i>may hair in October 2020. Does this look like a person that needs to take hormone blockers to prevent hairloss? No. And that is what makes my situation even more painful to ruminate on ... :(</i>
      <br><br>
      <li>An ended relationship</li>
      <p>Believe it or not the Summer of 2020 was actually a relatively successful in the dating world for me. I was dating two girls and both of them seemed to like me. Don't get me wrong ... i was not being covid careless. My first three dates with one of the girls was socially distanced, and I only had one socially distanced date with the other .. though we chatted more frequently, playing online chess and texting atleast weekly, starting from before the covid pandemic. However, the one I liked more was the one that dumped me after the 4th date. She sent me a standard lets be friends text on october 17. And it put me in a bad mood, you might even say insecure. Insecurity is a powerful emotion --- might even be strong enough to make a man take a risky medication for a non-existent hairloss issue.</p>

      <i>The song I sang to myself after a text-rejection from a girl on October 17, 2020</i>
      <br><br>
      <li>Covid 19</li>
      <p>Now Covid is tricky, and its a prickly subject for me ... becuse I've had to endure a support system that keeps attributing my current situation to another soul afflicted with mental disturbance on account of the pandemic. Maybe their right .. but i havent had that appifiny yet. But currently what I can glean is that Covid did affect my hair. I was an extreme rule follower when it came to Covid. And that is why I didn't get a haircut for several months. The long hair looked good but it was hard not to notice. I started to daydream of having a long healthy ponytail. I've heard some chicks dig that. So in a perverted way I thought finasteride might help acheive my Covid tail </p>
